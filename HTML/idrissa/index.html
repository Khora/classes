	<h2> Welcome !</h2>
	<p>Stefano Klein was born to travel: Raised in Vienna but graduating from Imperial College London, he embarked upon a voyage of self-discovery that took him through the remote hinterlands of Ethiopia, Venezuela and Trinidad & Tobago, alongside stays in the USA, Japan and South Africa.</p>
<p>But unlike many who binge on travelling after university, Klein did not subsequently settle down to a career somewhere in the vicinity of his degree an MA in public health and epidemiology.</p>
<p>Instead, he developed a life-changing passion for photography that would propel him on yet more adventures.</p>
<p>Since then, his travels have delivered several distinctive collections; covering grassroots musicians in Haiti and Jamaica for Against All Odds and Alpha Boys respectively, whilst honing his style in more straightforward travel photography with Salvador, Bahia (Brazil) and Calais (France).</p>

<p>The first half of 2016 was spent in Africa, and a new collection covers a selection of educational establishments in Freetown, where young boys struggle to find their way back into society after a youth of disorder.</p> <p>He was inspired after discovering Fernando Moleres’ Free Minor Africa project, which details the wretched plight of Freetown’s borstal-bound delinquents, and attempts to offer solutions for them upon release.</p>

<p>However, after spending time on a follow-up project, Klein looked elsewhere.</p< <p>‘I wanted to show a different picture of Africa’, the mohawked photographer suggests over coffee in Central London, ‘not so stereotypical.</p> <p>Usually you just see starving people or you see warzones or other horrible things, but you don’t really see the daily life and the happiness that poor people have.’</p>

<p>Many of the most revealing shots are taken from five weeks spent in the Don Bosco Mission in the heart of Freetown – a Roman Catholic institution that offers 11-month educational programs to orphans, delinquents and other youngsters who have fallen out of the system.<p> <p>These homes were initially founded in the mid-to-late nineteenth century in Italy, France and Argentina, quickly spreading to Africa, Asia and beyond.</p> <p>It remains, by some counts, the third largest missionary organisation in the world, operating over 2,500 houses.</p>
