	<h2> Welcome !</h2>
	<p>This site has been created by myself to show that creating a Web page is not <em>rocket science!</em></p> 
	<p>On it, you will find information about me, a description of my favorite hobbies and contact information. Enjoy your visit !</p>


	<p>We work to prevent family breakdown and care for children who have lost parental care, or who risk losing it.</p> <p>We work with communities, partners and states to ensure that the rights of all children, in every society, are respected and fulfilled.</P>
<p>We are non-governmental and non-denominational.<p/> <p>We respect all religions and cultures and work with trusted partners in places where we can contribute to social development.</p>

<p>All the work we do is made possible through the generous support of sponsors and donors, institutional and corporate partners, and loyal friends worldwide.</p> <p>Your help is needed too.</p>
