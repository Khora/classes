 <h2>Dubai</h2>

 <p class="big" >
 The night i spent in Dubai international airport with my friends as we were transiting to TURKEY, Istanbul from Entebbe airport, Uganda. We arrived at around 9:30 pm. Me and my friends didn`t know where to go and wait for our next flight.
  All we did was follow where the passengers we boarded the same were heading, not knowing some of them had reached their destination. Little did we know that that was going to be a long night for us being our first experience travelling abroad.
  We decided to sit on the metallic chairs in the airport. Some of the people we travelled with was our first time we had met and strangers for that matter. Nevertheless, we were getting along well. To cut the longstory short, one by one we started sleeping the time was not moving as you all know a stranger in a new place. I woke up at around 3:30 am. We decided to move around the airport as time was moving til morning came.
   By 7:00 am all the new friends we were travelling with wokeup and we started looking for our terminal to transit from. Having moved almost the whole airport,one of us went and asked where our transit was and that was when everybody was happy and we arrived after moving for two hours.
   We sat on the chairs and waited for our flight. The plane was there then check in started and finally got in the plane. We were hungry not to mention.</p>

  <h2>Istanbul-Turkey</h2>
  <a name="istanbulanchor"> </a>
  <p class="big">

 The time was 3:45 pm in the afternoon when we arrived. It was sunny and alittle windy that time. We went through the exit. It was my turn to verify my passport,The migration officer stamped my passport and I moved and waited for my travelmates I had met from Entebbe airport.
   It was time to look for the forex BUREAU to exchange the little dollars I had remained with[92].My heart was pumping at a terrible speed worried that the money i had exchanged was very little for the rest of the journey.The person who was to received was not near as we expected.
   Some of our friends had a person to receive them at the airport,even as i tried to tell them that we needed help from them because in my mind i had a feeling we were going to the same destination.  One of them ignored me and i decided to move with a friend who was also looking for the same person.
   We looked for a phone to call our receiver but her contact was off.imagine how me and my new friend were feeling at that time. Thank God, my friend had a phone contact of his friend whom he called and he answered  and gave us proper directions to the place we were supposed to travel to.
    In the airport, we hired a private taxi to OCTOGER/BUS Station.we were carrying heavy matooke /bananas in sucks.  As my new friend was almost throwing away the bananas,ofcourse i could not let him do that.  We carried our bags and sucks full of matooke/banana to the bus station.well,guess what we met again the friends we thought had taken a different direction.
   One of them called us and we stopped,they asked where we were heading and the person who had received them took us for booking our bus tickets. Once again our hope was alive,don't forget we were told the journey was a long one to another city.

 we paid for our tickets and we took a sigh that we had been rescued.  We left for our long journey at 7:00 pm and very cold.  It was the beginning of winter. 
   
  well,the journey was far that i slept in intervals as i woke up.finally,at 7:00 am in the morning we arrived in konya.

    <h2>Konya-Turkey</h2>
    <a name="konyaanchor"> </a>
     <p class="big">

    The person who was to receive us did not come but instead sent another person to
come for us.that was our day one in a new city by the name Konya. We took a train the person who was sent to receive us had a train card and paid for all of us.
    we spent like 45 minutes to reach our place they had arranged for us. I admit it was not as organised as we had expected but of course we had to cope with life like anybody else.  The house had many people living inside during that time they had all gone for work. I won't talk much about this city but in summary i spent there a full year and alot happened in my life. I made up my mind to leave that city to try and move my life on for new challenges. I remember the day I left Konya I went and worked and it was a saturday ON 28th/11/2015.  My journey to Europe had begun. By 9:30PM I was on the train going to octoger/bus station. I waited until 10:30pm to begin my journey to Izmir where I was to find my smuggler to cross the AEGEAN SEA.  We arrived at 6:00 am in the morning.

   <h2>Izmir-Turkey</h2>

   <a name="Izmiranchor"> </a>

   <p class="big">

    On my arrival, in Izmir i found out that my smuggler wasn't around to receive me.i had to call him on his mobile.He started directing me to a place i can not recall where i was to find accomodation. He told me to give my phone to anybody who knew how to speak turkish language,which i did.Then i was told to get inside a bus
and i took my seat.  Passengers started coming inside and the bus was full.We moved for 20mintues and i got off the bus.  I made another call to my smuggler to further direct me to the hotel i was to get accomodation. I was new and all i had to do was to find another good samaritan to help me once again. Finally, i got to the hotel i was to meet the smuggler from,he told me he was far away and that he would meet me on monday. To cut the longstory short,time moved until mid night and i was not given a room to sleep instead i was given a blanket and a pillow i slep on the reception sofa. I was very tired i woke up in the morning.  Remember the money i had on me was not to be wasted on things i did not know about apart from the exchange of 10 dollars for food,i was starving.
   Lateron,late at night the smuggler came i was given a room ofcourse after i had paid him his money we had agreed upon.  Next morning we set off for the next town along the way i met with a friend from Sudan.  by the way till now we are best friends.  I never regreted meeting such a wonderful soul in my life and journey.
   It was time to board the bus to a place called BODRUM. We met with some syrian family on our journey from Izmir.  At around 12:00 PM.  We arrived at Bodrum and again boarded to Didim where we stayed for four days still waiting for the waves of the sea to calm down. That night at 8:00 PM We got inside our dingy/small boat.     	After like four hours on Aegean sea our boat hit a rock and staggered alittle bit but credit to God first,the boat driver was calm to control the situation we got to the rocks safely.  I was nervous the whole time, we spent the night on the Island called Nira in GREECE.we had arrived in Europe finally.

  <h2>Athens-Greece</h2>
  <a name="athensanchor"></a>
  <p class="big">

    During that morning, it was cold and, we spent the whole night in the cold all surrounded the fire we lite to get warmth.  We started moving to where the ship was docked.  I had to change my clothes to put on others because the color had turned due to the smoke of the fire. There was registration for everyone to board the ship.  We were given numbers written on our hands and a written document to be identified easily for further simplicity in records of Greece or other European countries.  It was time to get inside the ship and moved to an Island called Samos.  There we spent 7 days after being cleared, I got my document but I had to wait for my friend who was still waiting for his too.  The next day around 7:00pm he got his document and had also booked his ferry ticket to Athens.  At 10:00pm in the night the ferry docked we got inside.  Wow, I must say this, it was an amazing experience heading to ATHENS,GREECE.  We reached at 7:00am and had no idea where to start from, but in the end we got to a camp called ELEONAS and were given shelter. That was my journey to Europe, though I tried to summarise it.
