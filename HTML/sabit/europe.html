 <h2>Dubai</h2>

 <p>
 The night i spent in Dubai international airport with my friends as we were transiting to TURKEY, Istanbul from Entebbe airport, Uganda. We arrived at around 9:30 pm. Me and my friends didn`t know where to go and wait for our next flight.
  All we did was follow where the passengers we boarded the same were heading, not knowing some of them had reached their destination. Little did we know that that was going to be a long night for us being our first experience travelling abroad.
  We decided to sit on the metallic chairs in the airport. Some of the people we travelled with was our first time we had met and strangers for that matter. Nevertheless, we were getting along well. To cut the longstory short, one by one we started sleeping the time was not moving as you all know a stranger in a new place. I woke up at around 3:30 am. We decided to move around the airport as time was moving til morning came.
   By 7:00 am all the new friends we were travelling with wokeup and we started looking for our terminal to transit from. Having moved almost the whole airport,one of us went and asked where our transit was and that was when everybody was happy and we arrived after moving for two hours.
   We sat on the chairs and waited for our flight. The plane was there then check in started and finally got in the plane. We were hungry not to mention.</p>
